        <h1>Learned <span>Languages</span></h1>
        <br>
        <h2>1. <span>HTML</span> (Oktober 2021 - March 2022)</h2>
        <h3>I started with HTML by seeing it in class. Then I started wondering around with making my own websites, my teacher kept motivating me to continue further on this. And that's what I did until I found CSS.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>2. <span>CSS</span> (March 2022 - September 2022)</h2>
        <h3>When I discovered CSS, I started making "cool" websites as I was thinking back then. I enjoyed the journey of CSS and making my own animations and designs. This was the second shortest period that I've ever spent "maining" a coding language.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>3. <span>Python</span> (September 2022 - February 2023)</h2>
        <h3>When my IT teacher teached us about python, it shocked me. Being able to use it almost anywhere made me want to learn it. So I did, I spent over 5 months learning the language. Until I quit it as I found more advanced languages.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>4. <span>Skript</span> (Oktober 2022 - May 2024)</h2>
        <h3>Skript was the fourth language I learned. I saw Skript as an opportunity to start out Minecraft developing. I was always into games and trying to make my own version of them, and then I started experimenting around. Which was when I started enjoying developing. Then I kept doing skript for 2 more years, making Skript the language I have most experience with.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>5. <span>Roblox LUA</span> (June 2023 - July 2023)</h2>
        <h3>As most of people have, I also played Roblox games. While doing that, I wanted to make my own version of some of the games. So that's what I did, dive into Roblox Studio and started grinding out tutorials to learn the language. I never gave up, then I started making Roblox games. And I quit as I stopped liking Roblox.</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>6. <span>Java</span> (March 2024 - Present)</h2>
        <h3>I was always being made fun of of using Skript. That's why I decided to learn Java, especially for Minecraft Plugins. I started Java as a fun side quest to see if I liked it, and then I started making more advanced programs using the language as I enjoyed it so much. I still enjoy java to this day and am not going to give up on it any time soon.</h3>
